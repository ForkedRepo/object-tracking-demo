You know how they say you shouldn't start a speech with an apology (because it
drops the interest of any listener even before you start). Well, that true.
However, I'm *sorry*, but:

1. **No, this is not an example how you write good code.** It's a project with a
   lot of bubble gum to keep of, whatever it does, not totally falling apart.
   And often, it falls apart i.e. crashes are eminent. Hell, it might even break
   your device, so be careful with it, ok? It might get better with time
   (patches), but we will not promise anything.
2. **No, this is not a feature complete, 100 % verified and tested demo.** It
   started as a test, a proof-of-concept if you will, and it hasn't evolved
   further although it roughly does what it was meant to do. There's still a
   long way to go so that we could say it even functions on 50 % capacity.
   That said, it still provides some rudimentary architecture, which makes
   sense and you are free to utilize that should you want to implement something
   similar. It provides a set of different, reusable methods for image
   processing and analysis. And every bit is yours to keep - unless you're
   planning some evil scheme of world domination or something.
